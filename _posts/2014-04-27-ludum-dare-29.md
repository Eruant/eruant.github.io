This has been my best [Ludum Dare][ludum] so far. I've used [Phaser][phaser] to create a nice little platformer.

You take control of an octopus, who is on the search for treasure. You have to open gates on your way using keys lying around.

I feel quite pleased about the game, it's a step up from what I've done before. There were a few things I would have like to have done better, such as adding enemies, or some form of AI. I think I did well for 48 hours.

I'll do a follow up post to explain more, and let you know about the reaction I got.
