I've played quite a few games over the past few weeks (102 to be precise). They were all part of [Ludum Dare][ludum], a 48 hour game jam. Some of the games were great, others were unfinished and buggy. I'll attempt to point out some of the best ones.

## [Wormhunter][wormhunter]

It's you vs the beast, a simple hack and slash game. I loved the styles of this, really nice pixel art.

Rated 5/5

## [Basement][basement]

I've spent too much time playing this game. Think breaking bad meets Sim tower.

Rated 5/5

## [Sub Human][subhuman]

You play as two people at the same time, one above the surface and one below it. The graphics are great, and it's very playable.

Rated 4/5

## [Planet Improver][planetimprover]

Not for everyone, but I liked this text based game. It's your job to terraform a planet. You control what is happening with an old school command line computer.

Rated 5/5

## [Beyond The Dark][beyondthedark]

You play as a miner who is trapped beneath the surface. The lighting impressed me about this one, dark and dingy! I wasn't a massive fan of the controls though.

Rated 4/5

## [Dig Hard][dighard]

Did down to the core of the planet to save the president. Fantastics arcade actions, guns and dinosaurs.

Rated 5/5

## [Beneath Colossal][benethcolossal]

Beneath Colossal is the story of an ancient myth that haunts the nearby lands. Another game with amazing pixel graphics.

Rated 4/5

## [No Eyes Willy][noeyeswilly]

One of my favourite games I played. It's a simple platform game, where you don't control Willy directly but stop him from falling into things. It's got a great colour scheme, simple and muted.

Rated 5/5

## [The Monastery][monastery]

A party based RPG where you checkout an old monastery. Old school gaming at it's best.

Rated 5/5

## [UnderTheLibrary][underlibrary]

A great little platform game where your are a robot thrown into the basement of a library. Your task is too escape.

Rated 5/5

There are loads more games to play, and so little time. I would have liked to have played more games. Still the results are due in a few days so we shall see how well my [entry][entry] does.
