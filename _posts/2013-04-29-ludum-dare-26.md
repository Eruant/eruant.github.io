So I entered anther [Ludum Dare][ludum], with the theme was 'Minimalism'. I decided to build a game I've had in mind for a while. It is base in the classic Amega game 'Atoms'. To make it more confusing for me, I thought I would do a hexagonal grid.

Basically you try to take over the board by wiping out the opposing players.
