    <h2>One game per week</h2>
<p class="meta">22 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m being inspired. Before I took my current job, I was hungry for games. I entered <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> three times, and I thought I did quite well. My job is a curse and a blessing. I get to work on some amazing projects and with some top clients (<a href="http://bynd.com/work/">shame less plug</a>). Because I&#39;m inspired at work, I get home and don&#39;t feel the need to build more games.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.lessmilk.com/">LessMilk</a>. It&#39;s a site built by a guy named Thomas. Basically he&#39;s building one game per week; that&#39;s quite full on. I know I&#39;ve got a few games up my sleaves, but I&#39;m not sure I could build one a week.</p>

<p>I like to spend some time planning my games, and working on the framework to hang them off. This inevitably takes time, and I don&#39;t always get round to completing them. I&#39;m going to make a stronger effort to complete some games. Part of that effort is in blogging. I&#39;m not going to build a game per week, but I&#39;ll try to blog at least once per week.</p>

<p>As fun as playing around building frameworks is, it&#39;s time I let someone else do the hard graft and get a kick start. For an internal project I used a great rendering engine called <a href="https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js">PIXI</a>. It&#39;s a 2D WebGL tool that enabled my to build quickly, without the headache of all those shaders.</p>

<p>From getting a grounding in <a href="https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js">PIXI</a>, I got introduced to a fully blown game engine called <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>. I was happy to discover Thomas is also using it for his games. As a quick starting game I thought I would make a flappy bird clone, called <a href="https://github.com/Eruant/floppy-fish">floppy fish</a>. It&#39;s work in progress, but I&#39;m planning on actually finishing it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working on my game for the past week or so, and Thomas must have read my mind, because he&#39;s just added a <a href="http://blog.lessmilk.com/how-to-make-flappy-bird-in-html5-1/">tutorial</a> to point me in the right direction. My code will be diffrent, for a start I&#39;m using <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a> to organise my code, but I think I&#39;ll leave that for another blog on organising code.</p>
